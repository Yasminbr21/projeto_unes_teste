<strong><i>What is Lorem Ipsum?</i></strong><br>
<strong>Lorem Ipsum </strong>
	is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into <em>electronic typesetting,</em>
	 remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <i>Aldus PageMaker</i>  including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
